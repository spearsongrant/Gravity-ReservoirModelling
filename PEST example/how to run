This is an example of how to use the PEST methodology to calibrate a reservoir model against microgravity data, as described in the paper 'Gravity measurements as a calibration tool for geothermal reservoir modelling' by S. C. Pearson-Grant, P. Franz and J. Clearwater in Geothermics special issue.
Gravity files cellcorners.dat and gravityfactor.dat do not change unless the model grid or station locations change, and therefore are calculated before the PEST process rather than within it for efficiency.

To run, at the command line enter > pest model

Scripts/software required:
PEST
Python
PyTOUGH
TOUGH2 EOS1
density_dual.py (provided here)
gravity.py (provided here)


PEST files:
model.pst has the parameters of the PEST run
model.tpl has the template of the TOUGH2 input file, with the parameters to be modified according to model.pst
model.ins tells PEST how to read the output of the python gravity scripts

Gravity files:
cellcorners.dat - calculated in cellcorners.py from the TOUGH2 input file before running the PEST estimation process
gravityfactor.dat - calculated in gravityfactor.py before running the PEST estimation process

Other files:
station locations.csv - required for the gravity difference calculation
Runmodel.bat - called within model.pst to (re)run the TOUGH2 model and (re)calculate the density and gravity difference at each iteration.
