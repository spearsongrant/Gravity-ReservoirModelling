# Gravity-ReservoirModelling
Code to take TOUGH2 (or other geothermal reservoir model) output and calculate changes in gravity.

Suite of 4 python scripts to calculate gravity from density of fluid. This is set up for dual-porosity models, although scripts for single-porosity models, and for rock density, are also available.

This has been written by me for my use, but also in the hope that others may find it useful. It requires basic to moderate understanding of Python as well as a knowledge of TOUGH2 or other reservoir modelling code. Inverse modelling using PEST can be used to make the process semi-automated - see Geothermics special issue paper for more information as well as theory behind the code.
