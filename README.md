# Gravity-ReservoirModelling
Code to take TOUGH2 (or other geothermal reservoir model) output and calculate changes in gravity.

This includes a suite of 4 python scripts to calculate gravity from density of fluid. It is set up for dual-porosity models, although scripts for single-porosity models, and for rock density, are also available upon request.

As well as standard Python libraries, it also requires PyTOUGH to be installed.

This has been written by me for my use, but also in the hope that others may find it useful. Two examples are included, of the gravity calculation, and of the PEST parameter estimation.

Please see the paper 'Gravity measurements as a calibration tool for geothermal reservoir modelling' by S. C. Pearson-Grant, P. Franz and J. Clearwater in Geothermics special issue for background information and case studies (including the examples provided here).

Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in the code or any aspect of the work.
