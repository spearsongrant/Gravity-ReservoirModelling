# Gravity-ReservoirModelling
Code to take TOUGH2 (or other geothermal reservoir model) output and calculate changes in gravity.

This includes a suite of 4 python scripts to calculate gravity from density of fluid. This is set up for dual-porosity models, although scripts for single-porosity models, and for rock density, are also available upon request.

This has been written by me for my use, but also in the hope that others may find it useful. It requires basic to moderate understanding of Python. Inverse modelling using PEST can be used to make the process semi-automated - a Geothermics special issue paper will shortly be published that explains the process in more detail.

As well as standard Python libraries, it also requires PyTOUGH to be installed.
